Variables :
A variable in c is used to store data values under a name which can be used in the program .
the value of a variable can be changed during program execution

Variable declaration : 
any and every variable must be declared before it is used
syntax : datatype variablename;
eg     : int a;

storing values inside variables:
every declared variable must be used in a c program. hence it is important to store values into variables
assignment operator "=" is used for assigning values into variables
syntax : variable = value;
ex     : a=10;

Initialisation of variables :
Initialisation of a variable is nothing but assigning value to variable while variable declaration
syntax : datatype varname = value;
ex     : int a = 10;
