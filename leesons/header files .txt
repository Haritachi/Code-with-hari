Header files :
Header files are nothing but normal files that contain predefined constants,variables and functions
In c the different header files are :
1. stdio.h      -   contains standard input and output functions(printf and scanf)
2. conio.h      -   contains configuration functions for program 
3. math.h       -   contains functions related to math
4. string.h     -   contains functions related to stringd
and more... 
the functions contained in these header files and as follows
stdio.h:
    printf :
        usage  :    used to print something in terminal
        syntax :    printf(string);
        when printing variable values : printf("fromat specifier",variablename);
        where format specifier - is an indicator of the datatype fo the variable to be printed
                                 the various format specifiers are:
                                 %i - indicates that the variable is int
                                 %f - indicates that the variable is float
                                 %c - indicates that the variable is an character 
              variable name    - the value of the variable to be printed in console
        Example : printf("hello world");
                  printf("%d",a);
    scanf :
        usage  : used to get user inputs from keyboard
        synatx : scanf("format specifier",&variable name);
        where   &variable name - &is used to specify the address of the variable name next to it
        Example : scanf("%d",&a);
